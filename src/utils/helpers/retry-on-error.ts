/**
 * Retries a given function multiple times if it throws an error.
 *
 * @param {Function} fn - The function to be executed. This function should return a Promise.
 * @param {number} [maxRetries=10] - The maximum number of retries before giving up. Defaults to 10.
 * @param {number} [retryDelay=200] - The delay in milliseconds between retries. Defaults to 200 ms.
 *
 * @throws {Error} Throws the last error encountered if the maximum number of retries is reached.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A Promise that resolves if the function succeeds within the maximum retries,
 *                          or rejects with the last error if all retries fail.
