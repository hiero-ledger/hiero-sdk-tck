# Hiero SDK TCK

A Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) is a set of tools, documentation, and test suites used to verify whether a software implementation conforms to a specific technology standard or specification.
The TCK aims to verify compliant implementations of a Hiero SDK.
It will encompass tests that validate the implementation of consensus node software transactions and queries, performance and longevity testing.

## Setup

First you need to clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-tck.git
```

The TCK provides ready-to-use configurations to run tests against the [Hedera testnet](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/networks) or [hedera-local-node](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-local-node).
In near future hedera-local-node will be transfered to Hiero (see our [transition document](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero/blob/main/transition.md) for more details).

### Configure usage of Hedera Testnet

- Get a Hedera testnet account ID and private key [here](https://portal.hedera.com/register)
- rename `.env.testnet` to `.env`
- Add ECDSA account ID and private key to `.env`

### Configure usage of local node

- Start your [hedera-local-node](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-local-node)
- rename `.env.custom_node` to `.env`

### Configure usage of a custom network

- Change the content of `.env` to fit to your network

### Start a JSON-RPC server

Start only the JSON-RPC server for the SDK you want to test. The JSON-RPC server for the specified SDK will parse the JSON formatted request received by the test driver. The JSON-RPC server will execute the corresponding function or procedure associated with that method and prepare the response in JSON format to send back to the test driver. 

By default, the TCK will look for a JSON-RPC Server at: `http://localhost:8544/`, but this can be configured by changing the `JSON_RPC_SERVER_URL` in your `.env` file:

### Install and run

Install packages with npm

```
npm install
```

Run specific test file

```
npm run test:file src/tests/crypto-service/test-account-create-transaction.ts
```

Run all tests

```
npm run test
```

### Reports

After running `npm run test` the generated HTML and JSON reports can be found in the `mochawesome-report` folder

### Linting and Formatting

To ensure code quality and consistent styling, you can run ESLint and Prettier on the codebase.

To check for **code issues**, run:

```
npm run lint
```

To **format** the code run:

```
npm run format
```

### OpenAPI Model Generation

The TCK uses OpenAPI model generation to create TypeScript interfaces and types from the `Hiero Mirror Node API` specification. This allows for type-safe interaction with the Mirror Node API and provides better development experience with autocompletion and type checking.

The OpenAPI specification is defined in `mirror-node.yaml` and contains the complete API schema, including:
- API endpoints and their paths
- Request/response structures
- Data types and models
- Query parameters
- Authentication methods

#### Generation Process

1. Generate the TypeScript models:
```bash
npm run generate-mirror-node-models
```

2. Clean up and reorganize the generated files:
```bash
task cleanup-generated-mirror-node-models
```

The cleanup task (defined in `Taskfile.yaml`) performs the following:
- Removes unnecessary `core` and `services` directories
- Flattens the directory structure by moving files from `models/` to the root
- Updates import paths in `index.ts` to reflect the new structure

### You can also run both steps together using (*recommended*):
```bash
task generate-mirror-node-models
```

This command uses `openapi-typescript-codegen` to parse the `mirror-node.yaml` file and generate corresponding TypeScript models in `src/utils/models/mirror-node-models`

## Docker

The TCK is also available as a Docker image, providing an easy way to run tests in an isolated environment.

### Pull the Docker Image

You can pull the pre-built Docker image from DockerHub:

```bash
docker pull ivaylogarnev/tck-client
```

### Running Tests

The Docker image supports running tests against both local and testnet environments.

#### Local Network (Default)
To run tests against a local network:
```bash
# Run specific test
docker run --network host -e TEST=AccountCreate ivaylogarnev/tck-client

# Run all tests
docker run --network host ivaylogarnev/tck-client
```

#### Testnet
To run tests against Hedera Testnet:
```bash
docker run --network host \
  -e NETWORK=testnet \
  -e OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id \
  -e OPERATOR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key \
  # Run specific test
  -e TEST=AccountCreate \
  ivaylogarnev/tck-client
```

### Available Tests
Some of the available test options include:
- AccountCreate
- AccountUpdate
- AccountDelete
- AccountAllowanceDelete
- AccountAllowanceApprove
- TokenCreate
- TokenUpdate
- TokenDelete
- TokenBurn
- TokenMint
- TokenAssociate
- TokenDissociate
- TokenFeeScheduleUpdate
- TokenGrantKyc
- TokenRevokeKyc
- TokenPause
- TokenUnpause
- TokenFreeze
- TokenUnfreeze
- ALL (runs all tests)

Running an invalid test name will display the complete list of available tests.

### Building the Docker Image Locally

If you want to build the image locally:
```bash
docker build -t tck-client .
```

Then run it using the same commands as above, replacing `ivaylogarnev/tck-client` with `tck-client`.

### Docker additional notes

```bash
# entry point for the Docker image. It sets the network environment, maps the ports, and runs the tests. 

RunTestsInContainer.ts
```

**Note:** This file is specifically used for running tests within the Docker environment and does not affect how tests are run locally. For local test execution, please refer to the instructions provided in the "Install and run" section above.
