# TransferTransaction - Test specification

## Description:
This test specification for TransferTransaction is to be one of many for testing the functionality of the Hedera SDKs. The SDK under test will use the language specific JSON-RPC server return responses back to the test driver.

## Design:
Each test within the test specification is linked to one of the functions within TransferTransaction. Each function is tested with a mix of boundaries. The inputs for each test are a range of valid, minimum, maximum, negative and invalid values for the method. The expected response of a passed test can be a correct error response code or seen as the result of node queries. A successful transaction (the transaction reached consensus and was applied to state) can be determined by getting a `TransactionReceipt` or `TransactionRecord`, or can be determined by using queries such as `AccountInfoQuery` or `AccountBalanceQuery` and investigating for the required changes (creations, updates, etc.). The mirror node can also be used to determine if a transaction was successful via its rest API. Error codes are obtained from the response code proto files.

## JSON-RPC API Endpoint Documentation

### Method Name

`transferCrypto`

### Input Parameters

| Parameter Name          | Type                                                    | Required/Optional | Description/Notes         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| transfers               | list<[json object](../common/Transfers.md)>             | optional          | The transfer information. |
| commonTransactionParams | [json object](../common/CommonTransactionParameters.md) | optional          |                           |

### Output Parameters

| Parameter Name | Type   | Description/Notes                                                                |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| status         | string | The status of the submitted `TransferTransaction` (from a `TransactionReceipt`). |

### Additional Notes

The tests contained in this specification will assume that valid sender and receiver accounts were already successfully created. The sender should have an initial balance of 10 hbar for hbar transfers. <CREATED_SENDER_ID> will denote the ID of the sender account and <CREATED_SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY> will denote the private key of the account as a DER-encoded hex string. <CREATED_RECEIVER_ID> will the denote the ID of the receiver account, and <CREATED_RECEIVER_PRIVATE_KEY> will denote the private key of the account as a DER-encoded hex string. For tests that require tokens, they will assume a valid token has already been created. <CREATED_TOKEN_ID> will denote the ID of this token. For tests that require NFTs, they will assume one valid NFT was minted. <NFT_SERIAL_NUMBER> will denote the serial number of the minted NFT. For tests that require decimals, they will assume a valid token was created with two decimals. For tests that require an approval, they will assume another account has been created and an allowance has been approved for that account. <CREATED_ALLOWANCED_ID> will denote the ID of the allowanced account, and <CREATED_ALLOWANCED_PRIVATE_KEY> will denote the private key of the account as a DER-encoded hex string. 

## Function Tests

### **AddHbarTransfer:**

- Transfer hbar from an account to another account.
